    <h2>This is a testing application where you can take and create tests</h2>
    <p><strong>Non-authorized users</strong> can view all available tests by going to the <strong>"All Tests"</strong> section in the top navigation menu and take any of them without saving the results.</p>

    <h3>Authorization:</h3>
    <p>To log in, go to the <strong>"Account"</strong> section in the top navigation menu. If you are not logged in, the login page will appear. If you do not have an account yet, the login page will contain a link to register after all the fields to be filled in. Authorised users in this section will be able to see their account information and change or log out of their account.</p>

    <h3>For students:</h3>
    <p>When you log in as a student, the result of each test you take will be saved. You can view the results of all tests by going to the <strong>"Passed Tests"</strong> section in the top navigation menu.</p>

    <h3>For teachers:</h3>
    <p>Once you are logged in as a teacher, you can create new tests by going to the <strong>"All Tests"</strong> section in the top navigation menu and clicking on the <strong>"Add new test +"</strong> button to be taken to the test creation page where you can add questions, images and answer options. Also, if you are logged in as a teacher, you will see the entire test with the correct answers to it at once when you click on the link of any test. Also, for teachers, instead of the <strong>"Passed Tests"</strong> section, the <strong>"Created Tests"</strong> section appears where the results of passing your tests by students will be displayed, the name of the test, the result and the name of the student who passed are displayed.</p>
